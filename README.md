## Steps to be Secure

### Private VPN Connection

Browsing the internet requires an internet connection with an IP address. When a website is accessed, the website operator gains knowledge of the user's IP address and approximate location. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes all internet connections through its server, ensuring a degree of anonymity.

#### Proxychains

Proxychains facilitates connections through proxy servers and the Tor network, making it significantly more challenging to disclose one's own IP.

## Collection of Relevant Cybersecurity Resources

This section serves as a compilation of valuable content related to Linux, programming, and cybersecurity.

**Objective:** Aggregate knowledge from various sources.

## login_notification

Servers deeply integrated into systems must be adequately secured. Login notifications automatically inform administrators of all logins, enabling timely responses.

**Objective:** Receive alerts of unauthorized access and take appropriate measures.

## Update_notification

Computers, servers, and similar systems offer users a multitude of capabilities. Security is a fundamental aspect to ensure their functionality. Regular updates provide a crucial foundation for security. Additionally, users want to be informed about the status of their systems and any issues without manual checks. The automated update feature with email notifications is designed for servers that are operational 24/7.

### Functionality

- Automated updates
- Email notification of update status
  - Each system can be assigned a name
  - The email clearly indicates which system was updated and what changes were made

**Objective:** Maintain an overview of the update status for all systems.

Feel free to explore and contribute to enhance the security practices shared in this repository.
